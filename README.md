<h1> SRT to FCPXML File Converter </h1>
This is a script that can be used to convert a <ins><b>S</b></ins>ub<ins><b>R</b></ins>ip Sub<ins><b>t</b></ins>itle (SRT) file to a <ins><b>F</b></ins>inal <ins><b>C</b></ins>ut <ins><b>P</b></ins>ro E<ins><b>X</b></ins>tensible <ins><b>M</b></ins>ark-Up <ins><b>L</b></ins>anguage (FCPXML) file.

<h2> Prerequisites </h2>
<ul>
  <li> Java Development Kit 18 (JDK 18) </li>  
  <li> The latest Java Run-time Environment </li>
</ul>

<h2> How to run </h2>
<ol>
  <li> Download all the files </li>
  <li> Using the command line (Windows), navigate to the folder in which the three files are stored </li>
  <li> Run the following command: "javac Main.java"</li>
  <li> Finally, to run the program, you can run this command: "java Main"
</ol>
<p> The application will guide you on what to enter </p>

<h2> Notes </h2>
So I wrote this application in a bit of a haste because I could not find any tool online that can handle SRT to FCPXML conversions. In the coming weeks, I will be writing an application that can implement an SRT to FCPXML conversion with the aid of a Graphical User Interface. Once it is ready, I will link it here.
